feat(tooltips): Enhance hotkey tooltips and fix bugs

This commit introduces several improvements and fixes to the hotkey and tooltip systems.

Key changes:
- The `hotkeyTooltip` action has been refactored to accept an optional `title`, allowing for more descriptive tooltips that include both a title and the assigned hotkey.
- Added `hotkeyTooltip` to the direction control buttons, restoring previously missing functionality.
- Fixed a bug where the hotkey for the 'Info' button (`I`) was not working due to incorrect key code registration.
- Fixed a bug where HTML was being rendered as plain text in tooltips.
- Added titles to the 'Main Menu' and 'Info' button tooltips for better user experience.
- Implemented a specific display rule to show the 'Info' hotkey as lowercase `[i]` as requested.
