  blockMode: "Blocked Cells Mode",
  blockModeText: "A more complex and strategic mode. The cell from which a move was made becomes blocked and unavailable for future moves. This forces players to plan their route carefully.",
  noMovesButtonTitle: "'No Moves' Button",
  noMovesButtonText1: "If you believe the piece has no valid moves left, you can press this button. The system will check your claim:",

  proModeTip: "Try this mode for maximum immersion:",
  proModeStep1: "1. Start with a 3x3 board.",
  proModeStep2: "2. In settings, disable 'Show Board' but leave 'Move Voiceover' enabled.",
  proModeStep3: "3. Enable 'Blocked Cells Mode' to add strategic depth.",
  proModeStep4: "4. Use hotkeys to control the game without looking at the screen.",
  proModeConclusion: "Now you can make moves, listen to the computer's response, and keep the entire game situation — the queen's position and blocked cells — only in your mind.",
  proModeNextLevel: "When the 3x3 board becomes easy, increase the size to 4x4, then 5x5, and so on, gradually increasing the difficulty and training your imagination!"
