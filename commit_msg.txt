refactor(tooltip): Improve tooltip system reliability

Refactored the tooltip system to fix a regression where tooltips (especially hotkey tooltips) were not appearing. Also fixed a related issue where destroying one component could cancel another's tooltip.

Key changes:

- Introduced `ownerNode` concept: The `tooltipStore` now tracks which DOM element owns a tooltip.
- Robust show logic: `scheduleShow` now verifies that the `ownerNode` is still in the DOM before showing the tooltip, preventing 'ghost' tooltips.
- Targeted cleanup: Added `cancelForOwner` and `hideIfOwner` methods to safely cancel and hide tooltips belonging to a specific element, eliminating side effects.
- Updated actions: `customTooltip` and `hotkeyTooltip` were updated to use the new architecture, including passing the `ownerNode` and using the safe cleanup methods in `destroy`.
