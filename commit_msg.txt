feat(docs, scoring): Document multiplayer scoring and architectural principles

This commit introduces comprehensive documentation for the game's scoring systems and
clarifies a core architectural principle.

- Documented the new "Fair Victory" scoring system for Local/Online multiplayer modes,
  including "Committed Score" and "Current Round Score" concepts in `docs/logic/SCORING_SYSTEM.md`.
- Clarified that multiplayer scores should use default text colors,
  removing hardcoded light-blue for `.fixed-score` in `src/lib/components/widgets/ScorePanelWidget.svelte`.
- Added a section on "Key Architectural Principles" to `docs/architecture/README.md`,
  emphasizing the "Golden Rule" of separating game logic from UI visualization.
  This explains that UI animations should not block core game logic.
